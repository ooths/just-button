# Just Button

Just Button is a mobile game by aleros.io LLC in which I'm making on the web.

## How to play

### Keybinds and mouse features

- Up and down arrow keys to increase increments by 25 (development only feature, will be removed in final production)
- Double click the top of the screen to toggle settings

### Aim

Your aim is to reach the final number, which isn't possible by just clicking over and over, you'll need to find a quicker way.

## Updates

### Currently working on...

- Making the toolbox menu buttons functional
- Fixing bugs

### After coding the whole game...

I plan to integrate Node.js for a better way of hiding and showing elements.

## Bugs

None have come up.
